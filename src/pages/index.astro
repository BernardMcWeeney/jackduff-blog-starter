				<h1>Jack Duff</h1>
				<p>
					The biggest Dublin guy who doesn’t live in Dublin.
					Doesn’t even follow Dublin GAA.
					Still somehow radiates Dublin energy.
				</p>

				<p style="font-size: 0.95em; opacity: 0.8;">
					Parody site for a friend. All “lore” on this website is fictional and for laughs.

				<h2>Jack Duff at a glance</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Location: Not Dublin (emotionally Dublin)</li>
					<li>GAA allegiance: Mysteriously not Dublin</li>
					<li>Primary skill: Being gas</li>
					<li>Secondary skill: Random history facts at exactly the wrong moment</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>What is this website</h2>
				<p>
					This is Jack’s totally serious online presence, built to document his public service to society:
					making people laugh, delivering unsolicited historical context, and posing for photos that should
					never see daylight.
				</p>
				<p>
					Start here: <a href="/about">Read the legend</a>. Then visit the <a href="/photos">Photo wall</a>.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Today’s historical fact (allegedly)</h2>
				<p>
					Jack loves history. If you stand still for more than 12 seconds, you may receive a lecture on
					the Normans, siege tactics, or why that one fella in 1916 “definitely had a plan”.
				</p>

				<h2>Send evidence</h2>
				<p>
					Have a photo of Jack doing something iconic, cursed, or both?
					Drop it into the <code>public/photos</code> folder and add it to the gallery page.
