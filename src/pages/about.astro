	<p>
		Jack Duff is widely regarded as the biggest Dublin guy that doesn’t live in Dublin. He carries himself like
		he’s five minutes late for a bus on O’Connell Street, despite being nowhere near O’Connell Street.
	</p>

	<p>
		Strangely, Jack doesn’t even follow Dublin GAA. Scholars have debated this contradiction for years.
		Some believe it’s a form of performance art. Others believe he simply enjoys chaos.
	</p>

	<h2>Known interests</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>History (especially the kind that starts with “Right, so basically…”)</li>
		<li>Laughing at his own jokes (someone has to)</li>
		<li>Having a “quick one” that becomes a full event</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Most reliable sightings</h2>
	<p>
		Jack is often spotted delivering historical monologues at moments that do not call for historical monologues.
		For example: at the chipper, during a match, mid-conversation about something completely unrelated, or
		precisely when everyone is trying to leave.
	</p>

	<h2>The Drogheda Incident (fictional)</h2>
	<p>
		In one entirely made-up account, Jack “evaded capture” after committing the heinous act of borrowing a library
		book and returning it slightly later than ideal. Eyewitnesses claim he disappeared into the night, protected by
		the ancient legal defence known only as “Ah here, I thought it was next week”.

	<p>
		If you’re reading this, Jack: this is your legacy now.
